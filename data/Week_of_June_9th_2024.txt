DINI'S TIPS & TRICKS
Here are some tips, tricks, and alternate serving ideas for this weeks prep!
Other TIPS + NOTES
-Use extra pasta for quick kid lunches 
-Use the pesto in sandwiches for lunches throughout the week and if you still have extra you can freeze in silicon ice
cube trays for later use.
-To make this meal plan vegetarian:
-Replace the chicken with chickpeas in the pasta dish.
-Instead of the steaks you can marinate portobello mushrooms and/or eggplant in the same marinade and grill. Or
feel free to use extra firm tofu that's been pressed and dried. You may want to add a little extra seasonings since the
tofu is usually pretty bland.
-For an additional easy side dish always consider keeping the following on hand:
frozen peas 
frozen edamame 
frozen cauliflower rice 
fresh salad ingredients

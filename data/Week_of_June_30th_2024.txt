DINI'S TIPS & TRICKS
Here's how to modify this menu to accommodate different diets!
Make it LIGHTER:
 
-For the Sriracha Lime Mayo, use light mayo and/or substitute some or all of the mayo with low fat plain Greek
yogurt.
-Sub in some cauliflower rice for some or all of the brown rice.
-Use almond meal or whole wheat breadcrumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs in the Salmon Poppers.
-Use whole wheat tortillas for the Cauliflower Tacos.
 
Make it VEGETARIAN:
 
-Instead of making Tandoori Chicken, make Tandoori Tofu! Combine the ingredients in a small bowl, and use a
pastry brush to coat the strips of tofu. Bake tofu on 400 F for about 40 minutes, flipping strips halfway through the
baking process. Another option is to marinate the tofu for several hours before baking. Be sure to store the tofu in the
fridge while marinating.
-You can also make Sheet Pan Tofu and Vegetables instead of Tandoori Chicken. Get the recipe here.

Make it even more KID-FRIENDLY:
- Serve the Salmon Poppers with a small bowl of the Sriracha Lime Mayo on the side, and encourage your kids to dip
the poppers in! You can also use ketchup in place of the Sriracha Lime Mayo if that would be more appealing to your
kids.
 
- Allow kids to add their own toppings and fix-ins to the cauliflower tortillas. You can also cut the tortillas into fun
shapes to make your kids more excited. Leave off the spicy ingredients if your kids don’t like spicy food.
 
- Allow kids to decide what they want in their grain bowls. You can use pasta instead of rice if that would appeal to
them more. You can also let your kids pour the Lime Herb Wash on top to make things more interactive.

DINI'S TIPS & TRICKS
Here are some tips, tricks, and alternate serving ideas for this weeks prep!
Make this week VEGETARIAN
-Use Beyond meat for the chili and and tofu in place of the chicken in the chicken and broccoli recipe. Just dust the
well dried extra-firm tofu in corn starch, season with salt, and pan fry until crisp. Then finish cooking with the stir fry
sauce.
 
To lighten Up the Menu
-Prepare cauliflower rice in place of brown rice this week
-If you want to forgo the tortilla for the burrito turn it into a seven layer bean dip swapping out black beans for canned
refried beans, and adding in lettuce and tomatoes. You can also fry an egg on it.
 
Make this week more KID FRIENDLY
-Serve the chicken and broccoli in takeout containers with chop sticks to make it even more authentic and fun!
-As an alternative serving option you can stuff the mushroom tofu larb into egg roll wrappers to make it more kid
friendly
-Serve chili in buns for the kids or even in tacos

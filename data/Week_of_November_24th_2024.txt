DINI'S TIPS & TRICKS
Here's how to modify this week's menu to accommodate different diets!
Make it Vegetarian:
Sub in tofu for the halibut
 
Make it Lighter:
Use almond meal or whole wheat breadcrumbs instead of Panko for the vegetable coating.
Use whole wheat bread when assembling the Avocado-Egg Mess.
 
Make it Even More Kid Friendly:
Put the sloppy joes in mini hamburger buns and secure with a toothpick.
Sub in French fries and ketchup for the onion rings if that will appeal to your kids more.
Allow your kids to dip their zucchini and onion fries into ketchup.

Sunday Prep for the Week of 11/24/24
4 SERVINGS
1. Vegetables
  
INGREDIENTS:
  6 small zucchinis, halved lengthwise, then
halved again lengthwise, then cut horizontally to
form small sticks
  3 onions, peeled cut into rounds (about 5-6
rounds per onion)
  1.5 cups cups whole wheat (or gluten free) flour
  Salt to season
  Garlic powder to season
  3 eggs
  1/4 cup milk
  2 tablespoons white vinegar
  2.5 cups Panko
  
DIRECTIONS:
Preheat oven to 450° and line two baking sheets with
parchment paper. Spray well with cooking oil. In 3
separate bowls, mix together each coating (mix together
the flour, garlic powder and salt to make one coating,
and mix together the eggs, milk and vinegar to make the
other coating). Create stations. Starting with the onions,
coat each in flour, then egg, ending in crunchy coating.
Place on baking sheet in single layer and continue with
remaining onions. Spray tops with additional cooking oil,
one final sprinkle of salt, and set aside. Dip each zucchini
stick into the stations just as you did with the onions.
Place on baking sheet and spray tops with oil and
season with salt. Ideally store covered in the fridge and
cook fresh the day you serve (blotting off any excess
moisture as necessary!) or continue... Bake for 40
minutes on the top rack until golden and crunchy!

eggplant. Drizzle with oil and season with salt. Massage
to coat the skin of the eggplant as well and place open
face down on the baking sheet. Bake at 450° for 20
minutes and then flip to cook an additional 20 minutes
until golden! Let cool and store.

DINI'S TIPS & TRICKS
Here's how to modify this week's menu to accommodate different diets!
Make it Vegetarian:
-Use a vegetarian-friendly meat substitute, such as Beyond Meat, to make the meatballs.
-Sub in tofu for the poke bowls instead of using salmon or tuna. You can also double up on the edamame for extra
protein!
-Use seitan or tofu instead of the chicken for the Persian kebobs.
Make it Lighter:
-Make the poke bowls with brown rice, but then use cauliflower rice for serving with the meatballs.
-Use a teriyaki sauce with reduced sugar (or, alternatively, mix some soy sauce with maple syrup) in the recipe for
the Teriyaki Meatballs.
Make it Even More Kid-Friendly:
-Make the meatballs mini instead of standard size.
-Allow kids to assemble their own poke bowls to make things more fun.
-Allow kids to assemble their own loaded sweet potatoes.
-Serve meatballs with spaghetti instead of with rice.

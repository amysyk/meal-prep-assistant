Sunday Prep for the Week of 11/17/24
4 SERVINGS
1. Chicken Adobo
  
INGREDIENTS:
  4 tablespoons oil
  2 chickens, skin on, cut into 8ths (wings and
neck discarded)
  Salt and pepper, to season
  1 cup balsamic vinegar
  20 cloves garlic (pre peeled)
  1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce
  1.5 cups chicken or vegetable stock
  2 teaspoons dried oregano
  
DIRECTIONS:
In a large and wide dutch oven, or heavy bottomed pot,
heat the oil on medium-high heat. Season both sides of
the chicken with salt and pepper and place skin side
down in the hot pan. Sear on both sides until golden then
remove to a plate. Continue with remaining chicken.
Lower the heat and carefully pour in the balsamic to
deglaze-scrape up the bits from the bottom of the pan for
flavor. Next add garlic and soy sauce. Add stock and
oregano and place chicken back in pot nestling all into
the sauce. Bring to a boil then lower to simmer and cook
covered for 40 minutes flipping chicken halfway through
to ensure all is covered in sauce. Let cool and store with
some sauce poured over.
  
2. Chili
  
INGREDIENTS:
  2 tablespoons oil
  1 onion, small dice
  1 red bell pepper, small dice
  2 lb. ground beef (you can use ground chicken
or turkey instead)
  1 tablespoon chili powder
  2 teaspoons smoked paprika
  2 teaspoons onion powder
  2 teaspoons garlic powder
  1.5 teaspoons salt
  3 teaspoons chipotle in adobo sauce (adds very
minor heat but can omit). Be sure to reserve the
rest for Shakshuka!
  2 cups marinara sauce (or canned tomato
sauce)
  2 tablespoons cocoa powder
  1 (15.5 oz.) can kidney beans, drained and
rinsed
  
DIRECTIONS:
In a medium pot, sauté the onions and peppers together
until golden. Next add the meat and sauté until browned
breaking up all the clumps. Add the spices and chipotle
in adobo sauce and mix around for another minute or two
. Add in remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.
Simmer and cook covered for twenty minutes. Season
with additional salt as desired. Let cool and store.
  
3. Spaghetti Squash
  
INGREDIENTS:
  2 large spaghetti squash, halved lengthwise
  
DIRECTIONS:
Heat oven to 425°. Place 4 squash halves open side
4
  1 cup water down in a large (pareve) baking dish. They can overlap
as they will all steam together. Pour water in and cover
tightly with tin foil. Bake for 40-50 minutes until soft when
pressed. Be careful not to over cook as it won’t string
like spaghetti rather it will be mushy! Let cool and store
or string into spaghetti squash prior to storing.
  
4. Roasted Mushrooms
  
INGREDIENTS:
  1.5 lb. pre-sliced white button mushrooms
  6 oz. wild mushrooms of choice
  3 tablespoons olive oil
  Salt
  
DIRECTIONS:
Place mushrooms on (meat) baking sheet and roast at
425° for 20 minutes. Let cool and store.
  
5. Broccoli Rabe (or Bok Choy)
  
INGREDIENTS:
  2 bunches broccoli rabe, washed, dried, and
trimmed, 1?2 inch off the bottom removed
  3 tablespoons oil
  Salt, to season
  
DIRECTIONS:
Heat oven to 425° and place broccoli rabe (or bok choy)
on a baking sheet. Coat in olive oil, and season with salt.
Roast for about 10 minutes until stems are tender and
the leaves are crisp at the edges.
  
6. Polenta
  
INGREDIENTS:
  6 cups water
  2.5 teaspoons salt
  2 cups polenta corn grits
  2 tablespoons olive oil
  
DIRECTIONS:
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray with
cooking oil. Set aside. In a medium (meat) pot heat the
water and salt until boiling. Slowly pour in the polenta
and lower to a simmer. Add oil. Mix continuously for 5
minutes. Remove half into a storage container and
continue cooking remaining half for an additional 10
minutes mixing around every so often to ensure you
don’t burn it. Pour out onto the prepared baking sheet
and using a spatula form a rectangle about 1-inch thick.
This will be the polenta croutons! Let set up for 10
minutes and then cut polenta rectangle into 1-inch
squares creating the croutons. Store in the fridge
covered in foil, ideally on the baking sheet as you’ll be
toasting them the night they’re served. Let cool and
store both the squares on the baking sheet, and polenta
in the storage container covered in the fridge.

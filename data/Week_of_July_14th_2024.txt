DINI'S TIPS & TRICKS
Here are some ways you can modify this week's menu:
Make it vegetarian:
-Instead of using chicken for the One Pan Roast Chicken, make a sheet pan tofu dish. Add cubed tofu, salt, pepper,
sun-dried tomatoes and oil, oregano and balsamic vinegar, and toss well. Bake at 400 F for about 30 - 40 minutes,
until crispy.
-You can also toss tofu cubes with olive oil, salt, pepper and everything seasoning and bake on 400 F for about 30 -
40 minutes, until crispy.
-Another option is to double the beans and vegetable broth and sauté the ingredients for the One Pan Roast Chicken
(minus the chicken) together.
Make it lighter:
-Use cauliflower rice instead of (or mixed with) brown rice in the tabbouleh.
-Use whole wheat breadcrumbs or almond meal in the falafel burgers.
-Use non-fat or low-fat Greek yogurt in the Tzatziki.
Make it even more kid-friendly:
-Allow kids to assemble their own falafel burgers and pick their own toppings.
-You can make mini falafel balls instead of falafel burgers and allow kids to dip into tahini or their favorite sauce.

Sunday Prep for the Week of 7/07/24
4 SERVINGS
1. Baked Sweet Potatoes
  
INGREDIENTS:
  4 medium sweet potatoes, scrubbed
  
DIRECTIONS:
Heat oven to 425°F and place sweet potatoes in a
baking dish. Bake for 60 minutes until completely soft.
Cool and Store. For even faster cooking wrap each one
individually in tin foil and bake!
  
2. Brussels Sprouts
  
INGREDIENTS:
  32 oz. pre-shaved brussels sprouts
  3 tablespoons oil
  Salt, to season
  
DIRECTIONS:
Divide Brussels sprouts between two baking sheets and
roast at 425°F for 30 minutes until golden, shaking pans
halfway through cooking. Let cool and store.
  
3. Pickled Salmon
  
INGREDIENTS:
  3 leeks, halved, washed well, thinly sliced
  2 lb. salmon fillets, skin removed
  1 cup ketchup
  1 cup water
  1 cup white vinegar
  3 tablespoons pickling spice (*see note)
  1/2 cup pure maple syrup
  
DIRECTIONS:
Place leeks and salmon at the bottom of a large (dairy or
pareve) pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and
continue on a low boil for about 10 minutes until fish is
firm and cooked through. Mix occasionally to keep fish
from sticking to each other. Meanwhile, mix together
remaining ingredients in a large storage container to
make the pickling liquid. Once fish is cooked carefully lift
it (and the leeks) out of the water and place into the
container nestling the fish to fully submerge in the liquid.
Let cool and store covered in the fridge. Best when
served 1-2 days after it’s made so it has time to pickle.

INGREDIENTS:
  3 boxes extra firm tofu, drained, patted dry

lengthwise so you have 10 thin sticks. Place on (pareve)
baking sheets, drizzle with oil and some salt, and roast at
420°F for 45 minutes. Let cool and store.

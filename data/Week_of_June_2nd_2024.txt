DINI'S TIPS & TRICKS
Here's how to modify this menu to accommodate different diets!
To LIGHTEN UP this menu:
-Feel free to season and grill chicken instead of breading and baking. You can also pulse healthier crackers (Gigi
crackers) and use that as the coating for your chicken.
-Pan fry some cauliflower rice instead of quinoa
 
To make this menu even more KID-FRIENDLY
-Make the quiche in mini muffin tins (be sure to grease well!)
-Cut the schnitel into little strips or instead of full chicken breasts use chicken tenders for small, more dip-able bites.
-Make rice instead of quinoa
 
To make this menu vegetarian
-Make lentil (or black bean) burgers from the recipe archives instead of the beef burgers. You can also use meatless
soy crumbles instead of ground beef. If you choose this option, you may need to add an egg or two to help hold it
together.
-Coat extra firm tofu  (dried off well) in a light  dusting of cornstarch. Pan fry in a pan to get a crispy "nugget" instead
of the chicken.

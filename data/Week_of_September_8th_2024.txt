Sunday Prep for the Week of 9/08/24
4 SERVINGS
1. Spatchcock Chicken with Roasted Vegetables
  
INGREDIENTS:
  2 whole 4-5 pound chickens, *spatchcocked
(ask your butcher to do this for you, or follow
instructions)
  3 parsnips, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces
  3 carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces
  4 purple onions, quartered
  4 lemons, quartered
  Salt, to taste
  Black pepper, to taste
  3 teaspoons onion powder
  3 teaspoons garlic powder
  3 teaspoons paprika
  Vegetable or extra light olive oil
  
DIRECTIONS:
Preheat oven to 425°. To spatchcock your chicken,
place whole chicken breast side down on a cutting board.
Starting by the thigh, cut along one side of the back bone
with kitchen scissors ideally or a knife. Turn the chicken
around and cut the other side of the back bone until it
can be removed. Press the the chicken flat and splay it
open. Preparing the chicken like this allows for much
faster cooking and seriously-crisp exterior! Spatchcock
second chicken as well. Place chickens on two
parchment or foil lined baking sheets. Then divide
parsnips, carrots, and onions between both sheets.
Squeeze the lemons over the chicken then add to baking
trays. Massage the chickens and vegetables with some
oil then season chicken liberally with salt, pepper, onion
powder, garlic powder, and paprika. Make sure to
season and oil both sides. Roast for about 60 minutes
until cooked through (165° internal temperature) and
golden. Remove from oven and let cool.
  
2. Roasted Eggplant
  
INGREDIENTS:
  3 large eggplants, quartered lengthwise and
sliced into thin pieces so you end up with
triangles
  Olive oil
  Salt
  
DIRECTIONS:
Preheat oven to 425° and line two (parve) baking sheets
with parchment paper. Season eggplant with salt and
drizzle both sides with olive oil. Roast on center rack until

  1 teaspoon salt
  1 teaspoon oregano
  1 teaspoon cumin
  
DIRECTIONS:
Heat oil in a medium pot over high heat. Add onion,
pepper, and garlic and cook until softened. Add beef and
brown while breaking it up so there are no chunks.
Season with salt, cumin, and oregano, then add
tomatoes, olives, and capers. Bring to a boil then simmer
for 15 - 20 minutes so the flavors combine. Stir in parsley
and let cool. Store in airtight container.

Sunday Prep for the Week of 8/04/24
4 SERVINGS
1. Shawarma Chicken
  
INGREDIENTS:
  6 lb chicken on the bone, cut into eighths
  2 lb boneless skinless chicken cutlets
  2 tablespoons paprika
  2 tablespoons cumin
  2 teaspoons turmeric
  2 tablespoons garlic powder
  2 teaspoons allspice
  4 teaspoons salt
  4 tablespoons honey
  2 lemons, juiced
  
DIRECTIONS:
Divide the two chicken varieties among two baking pans.
Divide the spices, honey and lemon and massage with
olive oil. Let marinate overnight and cook fresh the next
day or cook now. Cover the chicken cut in eighths tightly
with foil and leave the boneless chicken breast
uncovered. Bake at 400°. The chicken cut in eighths will
cook for around 45-50 minutes. And the boneless
chicken breast will cook in about 30 minutes or so
depending on how thick the pieces are. Remove from the
oven and let cool. Cut the boneless chicken breast into
1/2 inch cubes and store covered with sauce. This will be
served with our Nicoise salad bowls. Shred remainder of
chicken (on the bone) and store in sauce to serve with
the shawarma bowl.
  
2. Boiled Green Beans, Potatoes, and Eggs

bright green and somewhat soft but not mushy.
Meanwhile prepare a bowl with ice water and set it next
to the pot. Using a large slotted spoon remove the green
beans from the pot and plunge them into the ice water to
stop the cooking process and keep them crisp and
green. Let sit for 5 minutes and then strain and store in a
container in the fridge. Using the same water, add in the
potatoes and cook for 15 minutes or so until potatoes are
soft enough to be pierced with a fork. Remove to a bowl

fridge. Lastly add the 8 eggs and boil on medium heat for
8-10 minutes. Shock in cold water, peel and store in the
fridge.

2. Dhal Tadka Recipe from Nina Olsson
  
INGREDIENTS:
  2 cups red lentils
  6 cups water
  3 tablespoons oil
  4 shallots, finely sliced
  3 cloves minced garlic
  1 tablespoon chopped almonds
  1 lime, juiced
  1 tablespoon tomato paste
  1 teaspoon turmeric

DIRECTIONS:
Put the lentils and water together in a (dairy or pareve)
pot, and bring to a boil uncovered. Boil for 35 to 50
minutes, adding more water if it starts to dry up. Keep
adding water to achieve the right consistency and until
lentils are dissolved and creamy. Remove from heat. To
make the Tadka, heat another small pot over medium
heat and add 2 tablespoons of oil. Sauté the shallots,
garlic, and almonds over over low heat until translucent.
Add remaining ingredients and let cook an additional 3
minutes or so. Reserve some of the tadka in a small
container (for garnish) and mix the rest into the lentils
using an immersion blender for an even creamier end
result. Add additional water to thin out as needed. Store.

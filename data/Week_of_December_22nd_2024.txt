DINI'S TIPS & TRICKS
Here are some tips, tricks, and alternate serving ideas for this weeks prep!
Make this week lighter
-Skip the gnocchi and serve chicken with mushroom sauce over a pasta alternative or veggie such as cauliflower rice
-Use shirataki noodles or zoodles in place of spaghetti!
Other TIPS + NOTES 
-Use extra pasta for quick kid lunches 
-Use the pesto in sandwiches for lunches throughout the week and if you still have extra you can freeze in silicon ice
cube trays for later use.
-For an additional easy side dish always consider keeping the following on hand:
frozen peas 
frozen edamame 
frozen cauliflower rice 
fresh salad ingredients

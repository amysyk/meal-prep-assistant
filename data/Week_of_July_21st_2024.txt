DINI'S TIPS & TRICKS
Here's how to modify this week's menu to accommodate different diets!
*Note that you can add whatever vegetables you want to the Tofu Lo Mein/Stir Fry. Some ideas include water
chestnuts, onions, broccoli, carrots, spinach. The recipe featured here is just to provide inspiration, but feel free to
use this dish as an opportunity to clean out your fridge.
Add Meat/Chicken:
- Marinate chicken cutlets in the same mixture that you would have used for the tofu. Grill, and serve in place of the
tofu.
- You can also marinate and grill a flank steak in place of the tofu if desired.
Make it Even More Kid-Friendly:
- For the Sheet Pan Tofu Lo Mein, instead of using spaghetti, use a fun shaped pasta that may appeal more to your
kids.
- If your kids don't get excited over salad, portion the Crispy Tofu Quinoa Salad into tacos, or roll it up into burritos.
- Kids love to dip things into sauces. Cut up the salmon into small pieces, and encourage your kids to dip it into the
tomato-basil yogurt sauce instead of pouring the sauce over the salmon yourself.

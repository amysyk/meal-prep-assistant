DINI'S TIPS & TRICKS
Here's how to modify this menu to accommodate different diets!
Make this week VEGETARIAN
-Use beyond burger meat to replace the beef. Alternatively you can sauté any blend of vegetables and/or beans and
use the same seasoning. Seitan would also work nicely here!
Lighten up this Menu
-Use other fish of choice (less fatty than salmon) such as halibut
-Make an omelette using the mushrooms and onions (and even corn if you choose) instead of corn bake.
-Replace couscous with cauliflower rice
Make this week more KID FRIENDLY
-Make the corn bake in individual corn cakes in a frying pan to make these even more fun and personal. Add in the
sugar as the kids will enjoy it more this way.
-Serve meat in tacos instead of bowls
-Serve lentil burgers in buns with ketchup to make it more like a real burgers
Other TIPS + NOTES 
-For an additional easy side dish always consider keeping the following on hand:

frozen peas

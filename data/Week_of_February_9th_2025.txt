DINI'S TIPS & TRICKS
Here are some tips, tricks, and alternate serving ideas for this weeks prep!
Make this week VEGETARIAN
-Omit the chicken from the tortilla soup and to add more protein to the meal turn the soup into a Mexican shakshuka.
Use the soup as your sauce and bake eggs directly in the pan. Serve with avocado, chips, and hot peppers on top!
 
Make this week more DIET FRIENDLY
-Make the sub sandwiches in lettuce or collard green wraps
-Use a lighter pasta, spaghetti squash, or pasta alternative for the tuna casserole. Or omit altogether and make a
nicoise salad bowl with the green beans, tuna, boil some eggs, lettuce, and top with your favorite dressing or our
favorite Green Goddess dressing from meal prep week #3
 
Make this week more KID FRIENDLY
-Serve the Peruvian chicken with rice in tacos
-Let the kids build their own sub sandwich filling it with anything they choose!
 
Other TIPS + NOTES
-I love using a mandolin to slice vegetables to be pickled. It’s not necessary but a great kitchen tool to have!
